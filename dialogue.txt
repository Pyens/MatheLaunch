{i}All my life, I've always had a dream.{/i}
{i}To make a game.{/i}
{i}I've always played video games. From Tetris, to Mario, to Call of Duty, to Genshin Impact, I've played all sorts of games.{/i}
{i}And someday, I want to make a game of my own.{/i}
So why not just do it?
Huh?
You heard me. Why not just do it?
Emma's a friend of mine. She takes BS Mathematics, and she's honestly a genius. She's always helped me out with everything, and she's a confident go getter who always pushes me to do my best. But still...
What do you mean? I don't know anything about making games!
Maybe... but I do. I played around modding for a while.
And I can teach you everything I know.
I mean, you can be taught right?
Great! This'll be fun! Let's get started!
Huh? Wait, now?
Heck yeah! Early bird gets the worm and allat.
What's with that worried look you got? Don't worry, we'll start with something simple.
How about a mobile game? Something simple too like pong. Just so you can get used to it first.
Pong? Uhh... Sure, why not?
So, first things first. You cool with math?
I mean, this kinda thing kinda involves a lot of it.
Umm... I-
I mean we're here now so I guess you're fine with it!
So, let's get started!
Okay, so first things first. You have a computer right?
I mean, you can't really make a game without one.
You do?
Then... well, before we get started, let's set up a timeline.
How about... one week? I mean, it's just pong ya know? Shouldn't take too long.
You can add some flair too with that time!
Speaking of which, what do you want to add?
A story? Characters? Dark mode? Anything you want really.
Just make sure to keep it simple. I mean, it's your first game after all.
I mean, we only have a week. If it's too much, it may be too much to handle.
So we should brainstorm a bit first.
Uhh... I want...
Well... that was a lot.
We've got a bunch of plans here now, but it's up to you to decide what you want.
Prepare a timeline for us. Keep in mind though, we only have {color=#B30000}one week{/color}.
So this is what you came up with?
Are you sure? Really, really sure?
Well, alright then. It's your game after all.
It's already getting late though, so let's call it a night for now.
Bye!
{i}Suddenly, me and Emma were working together on a game.{/i}
{i}It was a dream come true. I have to do my best with this game.{/i}
{i}I hope I can finish it in time. I mean, it's only pong right?{/i}
...
{b}DAY 1 - 7 DAYS LEFT{/b}
Morning, [inputname]!
Had a good night's sleep?
So, you're ready to get started now, right?
We have a lot to do after all.
Well, yesterday, you said you wanted to add a bunch of flair.
But before we can get started with that, you need to program the actual game first.
So, let's start with that.
I know you're not much of a programmer, I know how your Com Sci grades are.
So maybe you could use a change in perspective.
How about seeing programming as an making arguments with mathematical logic?
After all, programming is just a bunch of logic.
Uhh... I guess?
So, you know what mathematical logic is right?
You take Math 10 right?
...
Really?
You academic atrocity.
Finee, I guess I can teach you.
So, let's start with the basics.
So, you get it now?
Good. Let's go to your place and get started then.
Don't worry too much, it's just pong.
Here, take this!
Huh? What is this?
A rubber duck?
Yeah! It'll help you a lot with programming.
Trust me! Just try it out when you're having trouble.
Just talk to it, and it'll do its magic.
See? That wasn't so hard was it?
Now, let's move on to something a bit more advanced.
That took a while, but see? Progress! Just a bit left we can leave for tomorrow.
I'm going now, good night!
Rest well!
{i}With that, the coding was finished.{/i}
{i}I was so tired, it took days to get the game to work, but I was so happy.{/i}
{i}There was progress. Slowly, but surely, my dream was coming true.{/i}
{b}DAY 4 - 4 DAYS LEFT{/b}
Yo! [inputname]!
Hey Emma! Why did you ask to meet me here?
I thought we could take a break from the game for a bit.
You've worked hard to learn how to code these past few days, and you even got the game working.
So, why not take a break and look at some art?
Also, you wanted to add some 'flair' to the game right?
What better place than an art exhibit? You can get some inspirations here for the flair!
You wanted themes right? Well, here you go!
Let's go look around!
That was fun!
Did you have fun too?
Aww... really?
Sorry for dragging you along then.
I just thought it would be fun to look at some art together.
But at least you got some ideas for the game right?
Yay! I had fun too!
Today was great!
And look! You got some ideas for the game too!
Well, it's getting late now.
We should head back home.
Bye, [inputname]! See you tomorrow!
{i}With that, the rest day ended.{/i}
{i}With some inspiration, We could get started with the art tomorrow.{/i}
DAY 5 - 3 DAYS LEFT
Ey, [inputname]!
Hi Emma! Why are we in a cafe?
Well, I thought we could use a change of scenery for a bit.
It's somewhat cozier here than at home right?
I guess? It's not the cheapest place though.
Don't worry about it!
It's on me!
Anyways, we gotta get started on the assets for the game.
You know, the graphics and stuff for your 'flair'.
We only got a couple of days left, so let's lock in, and get started!
I am so not an artist.
But hey, we got it!
The game looks great! Just some small things to take care of, and we're done!
What things?
Just where to release the game.
I mean, you want to release it right?
But who would play it? I mean, it's just pong.
Well, you never know. You could get lucky.
Why not release it? We've worked hard on it after all.
Might as well, right?
It's getting late now though, so let's call it a night.
Bye, [inputname]!
{i}With that, the game was finished.{/i}
{i}Just one last step, and my dream was coming true.{/i}
{b}DAY 7 - FINAL DAY{/b}
Finally, we're done!
Just gotta release the thing!
So, we gotta decide where and when to release it, and how to market it.
Market it?
Yeah! Maybe an ad or something.
Why not? I mean, you want people to play it right?
Sure.
I already did a lot of research yesterday, did an all nighter and all.
So, you just gotta look at what I found here.
And that's that!
Pretty quick right? Thanks to my amazing research skills.
Anyway, we're done now!
When we release the game, let's celebrate!
{i}A FEW DAYS LATER.{/i}
THREE!
TWO!
ONE!
...
And it's out!
I can't believe we actually did it!
Yeah! We did it!
We made a game together!
Thank you so much for working with me on this! It was so much fun!
Hah! Sure you did!
That's that!
Let's make another game together!
...Sure.
Not right now though.
Of course not!
Now eat! This is a celebration after all!
That food cost a lot of money, so you better eat a ton!
{i}And with that, my dream came true.{/i}
{i}Together with Emma, I'll go even further.{/i}
{i}We'll make games that shake the world!{/i}
{i}Beginning with pong, we'll make great games together, as comrades.{/i}
{b}END{/b}
Damn man, your loss.
Anyways, I gotta go. See ya later.
And with that, I never really got started on my game.
Emma never brought it up again, and life just went on as normal.
I got my degree, got a job, and honestly...
I wish that I had taken her up on that offer.
My dream was right there, but... it's too late now. Oh well.
{b}Regretful Ending{/b}
